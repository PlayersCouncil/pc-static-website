						<h3>Welcome to the Lord of the Rings TCG!</h3>
						<p>Whether you're discovering this gem of a game for the first time, or returning to our ranks after a long break, <i>mae govannen!</i>  Welcome!  This page aims to be a summary of all the things you might need to know (or be reminded of) to be able to play the game.
						<br><br>
						The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game is a <i>collectible card game</i> where players would purchase randomized packs of cards, grow their collection, and construct 60+ card decks to compete head-to-head with one another.  At least, that was how it worked while the game was still alive; while some people still enjoy the rush and challenge of seeking out ever-rarer booster packs, various digital avenues have cropped up that permit anyone to play with all cards without a collection (and without grinding). 
						<br><br>
						The goal of the game is to guide Frodo (or another Ring-bearer) closer to Mount Doom by traversing 9 sites.  If you can make it to the last site without losing the Ring, then you win!  There's a twist, however: you will be playing as <i>both</i> the Free Peoples aiding Frodo <i>and</i> the forces of Shadow out to kill (or corrupt) him.  Your deck will be split 50/50 between cards of each side, and you and your opponent will alternate back and forth between helping and harming the Fellowship.
						<br><br>
						This push/pull dynamic of needing to play and execute both Good <i>and</i> Evil in the same match is the centerpiece of what makes this a unique game.  Your deck will need to be both effective against the stratagems of your opponent and in balance between the two sides you selected.  
						</p>
						
						<h3>Learning (or Re-Learning) the Game</h3>
						<p>The best way to learn how to play is almost always to sit down with an experienced player and play a match or three using a pair of basic <a href="https://lotrtcgwiki.com/wiki/starter_pack">starter decks</a>, which are pre-packaged decks designed to be simple to execute as you stumble your way through the rules.  
						<br><br>
						These first games can be played a number of ways, but the best way (for learning) is still to play the physical game.  The ability to hand a card over from your hand to ask a question of your mentor, and the ability to undo actions if a mistake is made, and the ability for your mentor to show theoretical actions all make physical play the most flexible learning experience.
						<br><br>
						If you can't get your hands on physical starters (or can't get your hands on a physical mentor), then the two digital options are Tabletop Simulator (TTS) and Gemp (both explained in detail in later sections).  TTS costs money, but aims to simulate physical cards and so can permit much of the same flexibility of learning at the cost of, well, money, as well as being a very finicky experience in general.  Gemp is simpler to navigate, at the expense of enforcing all rules at all times, so you can't easily ask questions of cards you have or undo any mistakes.
						<br><br>
						In either case, a good mentor can still walk you through the game enough times for you to get the hang of it.  Reach out on <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net/discord">the Player's Council Discord</a> where there are always people willing to schedule a time to sit down and play a first match.			
						</p>
						
						<blockquote><h3>A Word On Eras</h3>
						<p>Expansions for the game originally followed the release schedule of the Peter Jackson film trilogy, three sets per year.  Once the movies were complete, Decipher had to decide what to do moving forward, and ultimately decided to make some changes to some major elements of the game.  Thus, sets 1-10 belong to "the Movie era" and sets 11+ are referred to as "post-Shadows" (which was the name of set 11).   
						<br><br>
						Both of these eras have pros and cons, but while cards produced in each era are <i>technically</i> compatible with one another, there are some differences to how cultures are divided and how sites are used which can be confusing if you mix'n'match without knowing the differences.  
						<br><br>
						Thus, it is recommended that as you start out you pick one side or the other of the era divide and stick with it until you've got your feet underneath you.  Players will of course be willing to tell you which era is the "correct" one to play in their opinion, but for the purposes of learning the game the only important factor is that you don't get unnecessarily confused trying to get incompatible cards to work with each other.
						<br><br>
						If you can't decide, stick with Fellowship of the Ring.</p></blockquote>
						
						<h3>Self-teaching Resources</h3>
						<p>Once you've gotten your bearings (or even before then, if you prefer to learn on your own), here are some resources you can use to further your understanding of the game:
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://lotrtcgwiki.com/wiki/rulebooks">Official rulebooks.</a>  <- at this link you will find PDF files of each of the (known) rulebooks.  Read through a starter rulebook to gain a basic understanding of the rules.  You may as well start with the Fellowship of the Ring starter, but none of the starters are a <i>bad</i> starting point, they will just include a different set of mechanical explanations depending on what's in the deck.
							<br><br>
							Once you've got the basics down, get the Comprehensive Rules 4.0 from the link above.  This will go into more exhaustive detail and also doubles as an index to look up unknown words or mechanics.<br><br></li>
							
							<li>
								<a href="https://lotrtcgwiki.com/wiki/index">The LotR-TCG Wiki.</a> The wiki contains explanations of many mechanics in more depth than the Comprehensive Guide, but suffers from being incompletely filled.  It will however also double as a card database, where you can look up any individual cards and see what other players have written about them, including rulings and errata (official changes) to the card's text.<br><br>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								Video tutorials.  There is no all-in-one newbie-friendly tutorial video (yet), but there are several overlapping ones that will get you what you need to know if that's your favorite way of learning:<br><br>
								
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://youtu.be/w5m4N1BWUdQ">Official Lord of the Rings TCG Tutorial</a>.  While the game was still alive, Decipher produced a CD-ROM which included a program that would walk you through how to play the game interactively, with voiceover guidance.  ~36 minutes.<br><br></li>
									
									<li><a href="https://youtu.be/azvdgl4LScs">Gemp Tutorial</a>.  Walks the viewer through how to use the Gemp interface, without much if any gameplay. ~17 minutes.<br><br></li>
									
									<li><a href="https://youtu.be/ibDzs8_q2v0">Webcam Play Tutorial</a>.  The Player's Council shows how to set up your webcam and demonstrates how to play a game physically over the internet.  This method is only really recommended for first-time players if none of the other methods are feasible for some reason; there's a lot of relying on knowing cards at a glance.  ~1.5 hours.<br><br></li>
									
									<li><a href="https://youtu.be/GIbHF2nes4w">Team Covenant dead CCG stream</a>.  Several games are played back to back in a casual environment. ~6 hours.<br><br></li>
									
									<li><a href="https://youtu.be/UTy4hZynvTk">Tabletop Royale Card Game Necromancy stream</a>.  2 hours of playing.<br><br></li>

								<h3>Gempukku</h3>
								<p>When it comes to digital platforms, there's really only one correct choice: Gemp.  It is a website application that permits you to play the LotR-TCG in your browser, with all of the cards in the game freely available and the rules enforced by the engine.  It is not the most....<i>polished</i> of experiences, but once you have figured out its quirks, it is bar none the best available way to play.
								<br><br>
								<a href="http://www.gempukku.com/gemp-lotr/hall.html">Click here to get started.</a>  Register a username and enter the game hall, and you're set!  Do not forget your password; Gemp has no password recovery feature.  We would highly recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/azvdgl4LScs">watching the tutorial video</a> to get a hang of where to go and what to do.
								<br><br>
								The first thing you will need to do is create a new deck.  At the moment there are no built-in decks (although this is in the works), so click on the "Deck builder" link and put together a deck for your chosen format.  
								<br><br>
								You can also spectate other players by clicking the "Watch game" link on the far right of any active table.  This is a great way to acclimate yourself to the interface and is highly recommended to watch a game or two just to find where everything is before diving in yourself.
								<br><br>
								Don't forget the chat room in the main hall!  People will be willing to answer any questions you may have.  If no one's responding, also feel free to hop on <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net/discord">the Player's Council Discord</a> for help as well.
								</p>

								<h3>Tabletop Simulator</h3>
								<p>Tabletop Simulator is a quirky game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/">available on Steam</a> for about $20 USD.  Its name is descriptive: it doesn't aim to emulate any <i>particular</i> game so much as simulate everything you need to emulate <i>any</i> game with the right mods.  
								<br><br>
								This can lead to some annoyances, which is why TTS is only occasionally used for teaching LotR-TCG and is not a popular option otherwise.  Using a mouse to click-drag each card you move, without flinging the tokens on it, and without nudging other cards is an exercise in futility at times.  Not to mention accidentally <i>flipping the table and scattering everything on the floor</i>, which is an actual mechanic.
								<br><br>
								Yeah.  
								<br><br>
								To play the LotR-TCG on TTS, you will first need to purchase it, and then install the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2118493633&fbclid=IwAR28XHvryiTErVzkuZMFClTmHOViwPK64rCWwHLTShYGUJrFs8DpwG6KXrM">"LotR TCG - Regions and Starters" mod</a>.  This mod sets you down in a room surrounded by tables with a dizzying number of card stacks on them, which is the best way the mod authors could figure out to let anyone build the decks they want.  On the right are five Fellowship starter decks pre-made, so use one of those if you're using this for learning.
								<br><br>
								But please, once you have the basics...move to Gemp.  For the love of Arda.
