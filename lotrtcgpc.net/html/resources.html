					<h3>Archives</h3>
					<p>While Decipher was still around and active, the company hosted many files relating to the game on its website.  Many (but not all) of those have managed to be squirrelled away by the fan base, or extracted out of archives from the Wayback Machine.
					<br><br>
					All of the files that the Player's Council is aware of are hosted <a href="https://files.lotrtcgpc.net">in this file share here</a>.  Additional PC material is also added to the pile where appropriate. Some of the most notable files are listed below.
					<br><br>
					If you have any files in your own archives that you do not see reproduced here, please reach out to the PC <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net/discord">on Discord</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:playerscouncil@lotrtcgpc.net">playerscouncil@lotrtcgpc.net</a>, and we will gladly add them to the dragon hoard.
