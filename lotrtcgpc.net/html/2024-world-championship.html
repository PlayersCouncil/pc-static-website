					<p>
						Last year, the Player's Council ran our first World Championship and crowned basmelis the 2023 World Champion.  We are very pleased with how the event turned out, and we look forward to repeating that success with the 2024 World Championship!
					</p>
					<p>
						This year in <b>October</b>, the Player's Council will run the <b>2024 World Championship</b> and determine who is worthy to call themselves the best player in the world.
						<br><br>
						As the LOTR-TCG community hails from all over the globe, the event will be digital and hosted on <b><a href="https://play.lotrtcgpc.net">GEMP</a></b>, with live commentary streams for key matches including the Finals. Prizes (both physical and digital) will be awarded to the best players, and the best player of them all will be crowned World Champion for a year.
						<br><br>
						The event will consist of three parts: a series of <b><a href="#walk-on_qualifiers">Walk-on Qualifiers</a></b> and <b><a href="#invitations">other events</a></b> for players to earn invitations, a <b><a href="#group-stage">Group Stage</a></b> filtering down invitees via a Swiss tournament, and the <b><a href="#championship">Championship Tournament</a></b> in which the best of the best will go head-to-head in an elimination bracket to crown the Champion.  To enter the World Championship, players will need to <b><a href="#registration">register</a></b>, <b><a href="#invitations">qualify</a></b>, and obtain a <b><a href="#tickets">Championship Ticket</a></b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For those of you returning from last year, here is a summary of all the procedures we have tweaked:
						<ul>
							<li>32 instead of 64 invitation slots</li>
							<li>PC-Expanded is removed from the Weekend League and Walk-on pool (but remains a Format Championship format).</li>
							<li>The Walk-on Qualifiers will run a Movie Block Sealed event in each time zone.</li>
							<li><b>All replays and decklists will be released at the conclusion of every event.</b>  This means that the Group Stage decklists will be released about a week before the Championship Tournament, and players will need to take this information into account when preparing for the final games. You have been warned.</li>

				<div class="box" id="registration">
					<h3>Registration</h3>
					<p>
						The Registration Form will be published and provided starting in August, and all players who wish to enter the World Championship will need to complete it.  It will require the sharing of an e-mail address and a physical mailing address for the shipment of prizes.  If a player chooses to waive prizes (or if they live in a location which cannot be easily shipped to), then their prizes will be forfeit and will be distributed to other players, with no cash replacement or other equivalency.
						<br><br>
						<a href="https://forms.gle/thdeNo8VpAxuJ4Sb7">Fill out this form here to receive an email once World Championship Registration is open, as well as to subscribe to reminders for this year's event.</a>
						<br><br>
						After registration, each player will need a <b>Championship Ticket</b> to enter the Walk-on Qualifiers or Group Stage, and will require a <b>Championship Invitation</b> to attend the Group Stage.
						<br><br>
						Tickets and Invitations are discussed below.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box" id="tickets">
					<h3>Championship Tickets</h3>
					<p>
						Each player who enters the <b>Walk-on Qualifiers</b> or who otherwise qualifies to enter the <b>Group Stage</b> must register and obtain a <b>Championship Ticket</b> as part of their registration.  Tickets will cost <b>$5 USD</b>.  
						<br></br>
						Members of the community can also opt to become <b>Contender Sponsors</b>.  Such sponsors can purchase as many Championship Tickets as they like, which will enter a pool available for players to claim.  Players who do not have access to PayPal or for whom the cost of tickets is a financial burden will be able to request a sponsored ticket from the pool.  If you would like to become a Contender Sponsor, donate any amount (in $5 USD increments) to this PayPal account here: <a href="https://paypal.me/teltura">tickets@lotrtcgpc.net</a>.
						<br></br>
						Ticket sales will be used to pay for shipping of physical prizes, and the excess will be used to pay for Gemp server costs.  The community is thus encouraged to purchase as many sponsorship tickets as they like, as any extra will not go to waste.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box" id="invitations">
					<h3>Invitations</h3>
					<p>
						Players will be able to secure Championship Invitations in four ways:
						<ul>
							<li>By coming in 1st or 2nd place at any monthly <b>PC Weekend Qualifier League</b></li>
							<li>By coming in 1st or 2nd place during the <b>Format Championships</b> to be ran in August 2024</li>
							<li>By coming in 1st place at qualifying physical events run by the community</li>
							<li>By entering and performing well within the <b>Walk-on Qualifiers</b> in September 2024</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						See the following sections for details on each.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box" id="weekend_leagues">
					<h3>Weekend Qualifier Leagues</h3>
					<p>
						<b>PC Weekend Qualifier Leagues</b> are ran monthly in the 4th weekend of the month and run for 72 hours, from midnight UTC Friday to midnight UTC Monday.  Leagues rotate between PC-FOTR and PC-Movie.  The players who come in first and second place are issued a Championship Invitation.  In the event of a tie, then Strength of Schedule (opponent win rate, see below) is used to break the tie, and further tiebreakers <a href="https://wiki.lotrtcgpc.net/wiki/Tournament_Guidelines#End_of_Tournament">as used by Decipher</a> will be used as a fallback.
						<br><br>
						In the event that a previous invitee has already been invited to the World Championship, then their invitation will be passed to the next player in line.  
						<br><br>
						The Opponent Win Rate is calculated by summing the total number of wins achieved by all opponents of a given player, divided by the total number of games played by all opponents of that player.  This result is used as the Strength of Schedule for all league events in GEMP.
						<br><br>
						Weekend Qualifier League Invitation Slots:
						<ul>

				<div class="box" id="format_championships">
					<h3>Format Championships</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Format Championships</b> will be ran during weekends in August 2024.  Each of the PC formats has a time allocated for players to enter an automated Swiss tournament, the winner of which will receive a Championship Invitation.  There will also be some time allocated to some Decipher formats, one each for FOTR, Movie, and Towers Standard.

					<h3>The Walk-on Qualifiers</h3>
					<p>
						If you weren't able to secure an invitation via one of the above events, never fear!  The remaining available invitation slots will be reserved for the <b>Walk-on Qualifiers</b>, which will run across weekends in September 2023.  These automated Swiss tournaments will be scheduled to be accessible to multiple time zones, and will run three different formats, which will permit skilled masters of each format to earn their place, regardless of location or time zone.
						<br><br>
						The three formats used for the Walk-ons this year will be PC-FOTR, PC-Movie, and Movie Block Sealed.  
						<br><br>
						The number of Swiss rounds will vary based on attendence, with a minimum of 3 rounds (~2 hours) and a likely maximum of 6 rounds (~4 hours).  The Movie Block Sealed events will include an additional lead time of 60 minutes for opening packs and assembling decks.
						<br><br>
						The following Walk-on Qualifiers will be ran targeting availability in the following time zones:
						<ul>
							<li><b>US PC-FOTR Walk-on</b>: <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20240914T170000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">17:00 UTC on Saturday, 14th September</a></li>

							<li><b>EU PC-Expanded Walk-on</b>: <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20240928T100000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">10:00 UTC on Saturday, 28th September</a></li>
						</ul>
						Invitations to the Group Stage will be issued as follows: 
						<br><br>
						<ol>
							<li>The 2023 World Champion, basmelis, and the 2023 World Challenger, thefaker, are both invited to return (2 slots)</li>
							<li>Invitations are awarded to players who place 1st or 2nd in the Weekend Qualifier League (8 slots)</li>
							<li>Invitations are awarded to players who place 1st or 2nd in all Format Championships (12 slots)</li>
							<li>Invitations are awarded to winners of qualifying in-person events (0-4 slots)</li>
							<li>Invitations will then be awarded to the 1st place player for each individual Walk-on Qualifier (6 slots)</li>
							<li>The remaining results of all Qualifiers will be sorted according to a normalized formula (2 points per win, 1 per loss, total divided by the number of rounds in the Qualifier), using the Modified Median method for calculating tiebreaker Strength of Schedule. All remaining invitations (including for no-shows at the Group Stage) will be awarded according to the resulting ranking until they run out.</li>
						</ol>
						<br>
						If your time zone is not represented here, and you and at least 4 friends will attend, then please <a href="mailto:playerscouncil@lotrtcgpc.net">contact the Player's Council</a> for us to consider a new slot. 
						<br><br>
						Remember, attendance at the Walk-on Qualifiers will require registration and a <a href="#tickets">Championship Ticket</a>.  Players who attend the Walk-on Qualifiers will automatically be entered into the drawings for the Group Stage door prizes (see below).
					</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<div class="box" id="group-stage">
					<h2>Group Stage</h2>
					<p>
						The <b>Group Stage</b> will be a modified Swiss tournament with 32 slots available.  8 rounds of Swiss will be played, with 30 minute time limits, 10 minute breaks between matches, and a 1 hour break in the middle.  This means that the event as a whole will take 6 hours, starting at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20241019T170000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">17:00 UTC on Saturday, October 19th</a>, and will end at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20241019T230000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">23:00 UTC</a>.  
						<br><br>
						The first 4 rounds of Swiss will use the PC-FOTR format, and the second 4 rounds will use PC-Movie.  <b>This means that players will need to prepare 2 different decks.</b>  
						<br><br>
						Once all 8 rounds are complete, players will be sorted according to their track record and Strength of Schedule, and the top 8 will move on to the <b>Championship Tournament</b>.  If any of the top 8 are disqualified or otherwise unable to attend, then their position will be awarded to the player next in line. 
						<br><br>
						<span style="display:none;">
							Some door prizes will be awarded to random Group Stage + Walk-on Qualifier attendees (prizes provided by <span style="color: #61DAB7;">Card Game Geek</span> and <span style="color: #FF9F00;">CategoryONEGames</span>, among others), including:

					<h2>Championship Tournament</h2>
					<p>
						The <b>Championship Tournament</b> will be a double-elimination tournament for the Top 8 players from the Group Stage, played one week later.  These players are dubbed the <b>World Competitors</b>. Matches will once again be limited to 30 minutes, with a minimum 10 minute break between matches.  The finals between the undefeated Upper Bracket winner and the survivor of the Lower Bracket will be a Best of 3.
						<br><br>
						This means that the event as a whole will take 5.5 - 6.1 hours, starting at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20241026T170000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">17:00 UTC on Saturday, October 26th</a>, and will end at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20241026T223000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">22:30 UTC</a> (if the finals ends with 2 matches) or <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20241026T231000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">23:10 UTC</a> (if the finals ends with 3 matches).  
						<br><br>
						Double Elimination means that players will have to lose twice before they are knocked out of the tournament.  Anyone who loses a match in the Lower Bracket is eliminated from the tournament, and anyone who loses a match in the Upper Bracket is moved to the Lower Bracket. Thus, a player who loses their first match could theoretically still make it to the Finals, so long as they drop no more games in the grueling 5 match gauntlet that is the Lower Bracket.
						<br><br>
						Upper Bracket matches will be played using the PC-Movie format, and Lower Bracket matches will be played using the PC-Fellowship format, meaning that <b>players will need to prepare 2 decks</b> to use for the duration of the Championship Tournament.
						<br><br>
						After both brackets have run their course, there will be a 60 minute break before the finals, which as a Best of 3 will operate normally with a 30 minute time limit and a 10 minute break between matches.  The first game of the Best of 3 will be PC-Movie, but after that first game the loser of the previous game will choose whether to play PC-Movie or PC-Fellowship.  The overall winner will be crowned the World Champion, and the loser will be the World Challenger.
						<br><br>
						Prizes will be awarded to each of the Top 8, as follows (prizes provided by <span style="color: #61DAB7;">Card Game Geek</span> and <span style="color: #FF9F00;">CategoryONEGames</span>, among others):

					<h2>Rulings</h2>
					<p>
						Matches will be played according to the rules laid out in the <a href="https://wiki.lotrtcgpc.net/wiki/Comprehensive_Rules_5.0">Comprehensive Rules 5.0 Rulebook</a>, as implemented on GEMP.  This means that if a bug is encountered where the implementation of a card on GEMP is inconsistent with the official rules, the bug will stand as the legal interpretation for the duration of that day's events.  
						<br><br>
						Matches will use the Championship timer on Gemp, which grants each player 20 minutes of time bank and 10 minutes maximum between actions.  This means that matches will have an absolute maximum duration of 40 minutes, but this unlikely scenario is only reachable if both players run their clock quite low.  Most matches will run about 30 minutes.
						<br><br>
						Administrators will attempt to warn players when their time bank begins to run low, but it is ultimately the player's responsibility to track their own time.  
						<br><br>
						Players may concede at any time for any reason.  Any player who concedes is considered to have lost the match.
						<br><br>
						Matches will be configured to permit up to 10 minutes of total inactivity from a player, to account for outages or necessary computer restarts.  If a player hits this 10 minute inactivity timer before the match has completed, then that player is considered to have conceded.
						<br><br>
						During a match, players are encouraged to keep their communication between each other to a minimum, and to be polite.  Any player who engages in hateful or extreme language towards their opponent may be disqualified at the discretion of a PC judge, and may be banned from GEMP.
						<br><br>
						At any time a player may request a PC Judge explain the result of a card action, but players are advised that actions cannot be reversed and any explanation time will be "on the clock". 
						<br><br>
						If a game crashes mid-match due to a server issue or a game-breaking bug, then the resume-from-replay feature will be used to restore players to the point just before the crash, and an alternate action must be selected to avoid the crash.  If resume-from-replay cannot be utilized, or if the game is unsalvagable, then a judge will determine if a rematch is to be played, or if a winner will be declared, which will fall back on the time-limit guidelines if the game was too close to call.
						<br><br>
						If any unforeseen circumstances arise before or during an event (such a game crash mentioned above affecting multiple parties), then the PC may postpone the remainder of the event for a later date. 
						<br><br>
						Players will need to create a pair of decks before any day's events, one for the PC-Movie format, and one for PC-FOTR.  Decks cannot be changed for a given day's events once matches have started, but decks may be altered between events.  Full decklists from all participants will be published after the conclusion of the event, but it is up to players to not share their own decklists before that time if secrecy is desired.
						<br><br>
						<b>Decklists and replays portraying the Group Stage games will be released as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Group Stage matches.</b>  This means that the Top 8 will have 1 week to inspect their contents and make adjustments before the Format Championship begins.
						<br><br>
						Only individuals may enter the World Championship.  If any entrant is found to have collaborated as a group during a match, or consulted with another player during a match ("coaching"), or otherwise received information that they should not have had access to, then that entrant will be disqualified.  Group collaboration is of course allowed between matches or between events.
						<br><br>
						Invitations are not transferrable, and neither are Gemp accounts.  The entity being invited is the <i>player</i>, not the account.  Championship Tickets are also not transferrable once claimed, although if a player obtains a Ticket and then later discovers they cannot attend, the player can request the ticket be returned to the pool for use by another player.
						<br><br>
						Matches will be played privately between two players, with specators being restricted to PC Judges and approved Commentators who must delay any recorded broadcasts by at least 15 minutes.  Replays and decklists will similarly be restricted until after the event has concluded, and any player who is found to have reviewed an event replay or to have received information on their opponent's decklist before or during a match will be disqualified.
						<br><br>
						Sockpuppet accounts are not allowed.  If multiple actual individuals will be competing from the same IP Address, then this information MUST be disclosed during the registration process, or BEFORE a day's events have started if the circumstances were unforeseen.  If multiple entrants are discovered to have originated from the same machine or IP address during an event without disclosure, then all affected accounts will be disqualified immediately.
						<br><br>
						Finalists may not agree to simply "split the prize".  Either player may of course concede as is their right, but if both players refuse to play the Finals, then neither player will be crowned Champion and they will both be disqualified.  In such an event, the two previously most-recently eliminated individuals will compete as Finalists.
						<br><br>
						PC members are permitted to enter the World Championship.  In such a case, those individuals will be treated as normal players and will not be permitted to spectate or judge matches that involve themselves or potential opponents.  This means that such PC members will not be permitted to judge any matches for any Walk-on Qualifier that they themselves entered, and if they make it to the Group Stage they will be recused from any further judging for the remainder of the event.
						<br><br>
						In addition, any PC administrator who participates in the World Championship will have their admin priviliges temporarily revoked beginning in August before the Format Championships, not to be restored until they either drop from the event or after the World Championship has concluded, whichever comes first.
