					<p>
						This year in <b>October</b>, the Playerâ€™s Council will run its first <b>World Championship</b> and determine who is worthy to call themselves the best player in the world.
						<br><br>
						As the LOTR-TCG community hails from all over the globe, the event will be digital and hosted on <b><a href="https://play.lotrtcgpc.net">GEMP</a></b>, with live commentary streams for key matches including the Finals. Prizes (both physical and digital) will be awarded to the best players, and the best player of them all will be crowned World Champion for a year.
						<br><br>
						The event will consist of three parts: a series of <b>Walk-on Qualifiers</b> for players to earn invitations, a <b>Group Stage</b> filtering down invitees via a Swiss tournament, and the <b>Championship Tournament</b> in which the best of the best will go head-to-head in an elimination bracket to crown the Champion.  Details on each of these are below.
					</p>

					<h3 id="sponsors">Prize Sponsorship</h3>
					<p>
						Prize support for the 2023 World Championship has been generously provided by the following donors:
						
						<p>
							<a href="https://cardgamegeek.com/">[logo here] Card Game Geek</a>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Chuck Ward
						</p>
					</p>

				<div class="box">
					<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>
					<p>
						Players will need a few things to enter the World Championship: 
						<ul>
							<li>A <b>Championship Invitation</b></li>
							<li>A <b>Championship Ticket</b></li>
							<li>A filled-out <b>Registration Form</b></li>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						The Registration Form will be published and provided starting in August, and all players who wish to enter the World Championship will need to complete it.  It will require the sharing of an e-mail address and a physical mailing address for the shipment of prizes.  If a player chooses to waive prizes (or if they live in a location which cannot be easily shipped to), then their prizes will be forfeit and will be distributed to other players, with no cash replacement or other equivalency.
						<br><br>
						Invitations and Tickets are discussed below.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h3 id="invitations">Invitations</h3>
					<p>
						Players will be able to secure Championship Invitations in four ways:
						<ul>
							<li>By coming in 1st place at any monthly <b>PC Weekend Qualifier League</b></li>
							<li>By coming in 1st place during <b>Format Championships</b> ran in August</li>
							<li>By coming in 1st place at qualifying physical events ran by the community</li>
							<li>By entering and performing well within the <b>Walk-on Qualifiers</b> in September (which will make up the majority of the available slots)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>PC Weekend Qualifier Leagues</b> are ran monthly in the 3rd or 4th weekend of the month and run for 72 hours, from midnight UTC Friday to midnight UTC Monday.  Leagues rotate between the three PC formats, PC-FOTR, PC-Movie, and PC-Expanded.  The player who comes in first is issued a Championship Invitation.  In the event of a tie, then Strength of Schedule (opponent win percentage) is used to break the tie, and further tiebreakers <a href="https://wiki.lotrtcgpc.net/wiki/Tournament_Guidelines?fbclid=IwAR3MqwnlypQj20_lnG2tE3LCKZfafFcDsHgO783sXINh1aMzqejQnrHyuhM#End_of_Tournament">as used by Decipher</a> will be used as a fallback.
						<br><br>
						In the event that a previous invitee is the winner of a Weekend Qualifier League, then their invitation will be passed to the player in 2nd place, but <i>only</i> if that individual scored the same (as in, the only difference in their scores are Strength of Schedule).  
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Format Championships</b> will be ran during weekends in August.  Each of the PC formats will have a time allocated for players to enter an automated Swiss tournament, the winner of which will receive a Championship Invitation.  There will also be some time allocated to some Decipher formats, the exact selection of which to be determined later in the year.
					</p>
					<p>
						Certain community-ran events will also award an Invitation to the winner, including the <a href="http://frealaf.free.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1231">French Open</a>.  If you are interested in running such a community event, please <a href="mailto:playerscouncil@lotrtcgpc.net">send an email to the Player's Council</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, the majority of the available invitation slots will be reserved for the <b>Walk-on Qualifiers</b>, which will run across two weekends in September.  These automated Swiss tournaments will be scheduled to be accessible to multiple time zones, and will run all three PC formats, which will permit skilled masters of each format to earn their place, regardless of location or time zone.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h3 id="tickets">Championship Tickets</h3>
					<p>
						Each player who enters the <b>Walk-on Qualifiers</b> or who otherwise qualifies to enter the <b>Group Stage</b> must register and obtain a <b>Championship Ticket</b> as part of their registration.  Tickets will cost $5.  
						<br></br>
						Members of the community can also opt to become <b>Contender Sponsors</b>.  Such sponsors can purchase as many Championship Tickets as they like, which will enter a pool available for players to claim.  Players who do not have access to PayPal or for whom the cost of tickets is a financial burden will be able to request a sponsored ticket from the pool.  
						<br></br>
						Ticket sales will be used to pay for shipping of physical prizes, and the excess will be used to pay for Gemp server costs.  The community is thus encouraged to purchase as many sponsorship tickets as they like, as any extra will not go to waste.
					</p>

				<div class="box">
					<h2 id="group-stage">Group Stage</h2>
					<p>
						The <b>Group Stage</b> will be a modified Swiss tournament with 64 slots available.  8 rounds of Swiss will be played, with 30 minute time limits, 10 minute breaks between matches, and a 1 hour break in the middle.  This means that the event as a whole will take 6 hours, starting at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20231014T170000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">17:00 UTC on Saturday, October 14th</a>, and will end at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20231014T230000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">23:00 UTC</a>.  
						<br><br>
						The first 4 rounds of Swiss will use the PC-FOTR format, and the second 4 rounds will use PC-Movie.  This means that players will need to prepare 2 different decks.  
						<br><br>
						Once all 8 rounds are complete, players will be sorted according to their track record and Strength of Schedule, and the top 8 will move on to the Championship Tournament.  If any of the top 8 are disqualified or otherwise unable to attend, then their position will be awarded to the player next in line. 
						<br><br>
						Some door prizes will be awarded to random Group Stage attendees, including:
						<ul>
							<li>6x DGMA T-shirts</li>
							<li>4x Starter Decks</li>
							<li>2x Booster Packs</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2 id="championship">Championship Tournament</h2>
					<p>
						The <b>Championship Tournament</b> will be a double-elimination tournament for the Top 8 players from the Group Stage, played one week later.  Matches will once again be limited to 30 minutes, with a minimum 10 minute break between matches.  The finals between the undefeated Upper Bracket winner and the survivor of the Lower Bracket will be a Best of 3.
						<br><br>
						This means that the event as a whole will take 5.5 - 6.1 hours, starting at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20231021T170000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">17:00 UTC on Saturday, October 21st</a>, and will end at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20231021T223000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">22:30 UTC</a> (if the finals ends with 2 matches) or <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20231021T223000&p1=1440&p2=234&p3=70&p4=43&p5=213&p6=136&p7=195&p8=262&p9=22">23:10 UTC</a> (if the finals ends with 3 matches).  
						<br><br>
						Double Elimination means that players will have to lose twice before they are knocked out of the tournament.  Anyone who loses a match in the Lower Bracket is eliminated from the tournament, and anyone who loses a match in the Upper Bracket is moved to the Lower Bracket. Thus, a player who loses their first match could theoretically still make it to the Finals, so long as they drop no more games in the grueling 5 match gauntlet that is the Lower Bracket.
						<br><br>
						After both brackets have run their course, there will be a 60 minute break before the finals, which as a Best of 3 will operate normally with a 30 minute time limit and a 10 minute break between matches.  The winner will be crowned the World Champion, and the loser will be the Finalist.
						<br><br>
						Prizes will be awarded to each of the Top 8, as follows:
						<ul>
							<li> <b>Top 6</b>:
								<ul>
									<li>1x DGMA T-shirt</li>
									<li>4x Booster Packs</li>
									<li>1x Starter Deck</li>
									<li>4x Top 8 Promo (Physical + Digital)</li>
									<li>4x World Championship Promo (Physical + Digital)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h2 id="rulings">Rulings</h2>
					<p>
						Matches will be played according to the rules laid out in the <a href="https://wiki.lotrtcgpc.net/wiki/Comprehensive_Rules_5.0">Comprehensive Rules 5.0 Rulebook</a>, as implemented on GEMP.  This means that if a bug is encountered where the implementation of a card on GEMP is inconsistent with the official rules, the bug will stand as the legal interpretation for the duration of that day's events.  
						<br><br>
						Matches will be limited to 30 minutes.  If at the 30 minute time limit the game has not yet ended, then a winner will be declared <a href="https://wiki.lotrtcgpc.net/wiki/Tournament_Guidelines">based on Decipher's Tournament Guidelines</a>.  To quote those guidelines:
						<br><br>
						<i>Distance traveled on the adventure path determines the winner. A site is earned only after all skirmishes are resolved for that movement. The player who has traveled the farthest wins. In case of a tie, use the following tie-breakers (in this order):
						<ul>
							<li>Ring-bearer with the most resistance remaining</li>
					    <li>Fewest companions in dead pile</li>
					    <li>Fewest wounds on companions</li>
					    <li>Random determination</li>
						</ul></i>
						<br>
						Players may concede at any time for any reason.  Any player who concedes is considered to have lost the match.
						<br><br>
						Matches will be configured to permit up to 10 minutes of total inactivity from a player, to account for outages or necessary computer restarts.  If a player hits this 10 minute inactivity timer before the match has completed, then that player is considered to have conceded.
						<br><br>
						During a match, players are encouraged to keep their communication between each other to a minimum, and to be polite.  Any player who engages in hateful or extreme language towards their opponent may be disqualified at the discretion of a PC judge, and may be banned from GEMP.
						<br><br>
						At any time a player may request a PC Judge explain the result of a card action, but players are advised that actions cannot be reversed and any explanation time will be "on the clock". 
						<br><br>
						If a game crashes mid-match due to a server issue or a game-breaking bug, then the resume-from-replay feature will be used to restore players to the point just before the crash, and an alternate action must be selected to avoid the crash.  If resume-from-replay cannot be utilized, or if the game is unsalvagable, then a judge will determine if a rematch is to be played, or if a winner will be declared, which will fall back on the time-limit guidelines if the game was too close to call.
						<br><br>
						If such a game crash affects multiple parties, then the PC may postpone the remainder of the event for a later date, but only as a final resort.
						<br><br>
						Players will need to create a pair of decks before any day's events, one for the PC-Movie format, and one for PC-FOTR.  Decks cannot be changed for a given day's events once matches have started, but decks may be altered between events.  Full decklists from all participants will be published after the conclusion of the event, but it is up to players to not share their own decklists before that time if secrecy is desired.
						<br><br>
						Only individuals may enter the World Championship.  If any entrant is found to have collaborated as a group during a match, or consulted with another player during a match ("coaching"), or otherwise received information that they should not have had access to, then that entrant will be disqualified.  Group collaboration is of course allowed between matches or between events.
						<br><br>
						Matches will be played privately between two players, with specators being restricted to PC Judges and approved Commentators who must delay any recorded broadcasts until after the event has concluded.  Replays and decklists will similarly be restricted until after the event has concluded, and any player who is found to have reviewed an event replay or to have received information on their opponent's decklist before or during a match will be disqualified.
						<br><br>
						Sockpuppet accounts are not allowed.  If multiple actual individuals will be competing from the same IP Address, then this information MUST be disclosed during the registration process, or BEFORE a day's events have started if the circumstances were unforeseen.  If multiple entrants are discovered to have originated from the same machine or IP address during an event without disclosure, then all affected accounts will be disqualified immediately.
						<br><br>
						Finalists may not agree to simply "split the prize".  Either player may of course concede as is their right, but if both players refuse to play the Finals, then neither player will be crowned Champion and they will both be disqualified.  In such an event, the two previously most-recently eliminated individuals will compete as Finalists.
